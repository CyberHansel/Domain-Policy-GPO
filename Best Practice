* Do Not Modify the Default Domain Policy:
  - The Default Domain Policy should only contain account policy settings (e.g., password policy, account lockout policy, Kerberos policy). Avoid adding other settings here.

* Do Not Modify the Default Domain Controller Policy:
  - The Default Domain Controller Policy should focus on User Rights Assignment and Audit Policy. 
  - For other domain controller settings, create separate GPOs linked to the Domain Controller Organizational Unit (OU).

* Good Organizational Unit (OU) Design:
  - Organize your objects into OUs based on functionality or department.
  - Separate users and computers into distinct OUs. For example: Users OU: Apply user policies, Computers OU: Apply computer policies.

* Avoid Setting GPOs at the Domain Level:
  - Except for the Default Domain Policy, avoid setting GPOs directly at the domain level.


* Apply GPOs at the Root OU Level:
  - Link GPOs at the root of an OU to allow inheritance down the hierarchy.
  - This avoids the need to link policies to each individual OU.

* Always use security filtering for GPOs
  - Use GPO Security Filtering to exclude specific OUs or user groups if necessary.
